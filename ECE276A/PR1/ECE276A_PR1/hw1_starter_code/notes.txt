organizing data
- split into stop signs, no stop signs, stop signs that were unused bc they were too small/obscured

decided to reformat training data to select just red sections and see results with transformed color space
 tried HSV, YCbCr, LAB but results were bad
 rgb results were good with 75 training images
 added an extra 80 images of 'not stop sign'


 issues = optimizing code, but solved
